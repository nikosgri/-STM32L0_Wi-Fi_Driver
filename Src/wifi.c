 * @command: The command to be transmitted to the ESP32 device.
 * @exp: Looks to that expression in response buffer.
 * @exp_parse: Delimeters to parse the data, like "%d" for int, "%s" for string, "%c" for char and etc.

 * @function WiFi_init

 *
 * This function performs the following tasks to initialize the WiFi module:
 * - Checks if the module is connected to a network.
 * - If not connected, initializes the WiFi driver, sets the WiFi mode to station mode,
 *   connects to the specified router, and configures reconnection settings.
 * - Configures the module for single connection mode.
 * - Queries and retrieves the IP address assigned to the WiFi module.
 *
 * @return
 * - `WIFI_OK` (0) if the initialization and connection setup are successful.
 * - A non-zero error code if any command fails or if the initialization process encounters an issue.
 *
 * @details
 * - The function first checks the current connection status. If not connected, it initializes the WiFi driver
 *   with the `AT+CWINIT` command, sets the module to station mode with the `AT+CWMODE` command, and attempts
 *   to connect to the router using `AT+CWJAP`.
 * - It then sets the reconnection configuration to attempt reconnection at one-second intervals for up to 100 times.
 * - After ensuring a connection, the function configures the module for single connection mode using `AT+CIPMUX=0`.
 * - Finally, it queries and retrieves the IP address assigned to the module using the `AT+CIPSTA?` command.
 * - Debug information including the boardâ€™s IP address is printed if debugging is enabled.
 *
 * @pre Ensure that the WiFi module is powered on and ready to accept AT commands before calling this function.
 *
 * @post The WiFi module is initialized, connected to the local router, and the IP address is queried and available.
 *
 * @warning The function assumes that the WiFi module correctly responds to all AT commands within the specified timeout periods.
 *          It also assumes that the network credentials (SSID and PSWD) are correctly configured.
